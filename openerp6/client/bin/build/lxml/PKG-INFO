Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

        ==================
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Potential memory leak on exception handling.  This was due to a
        problem in Cython, not lxml itself.
        
        * Failing import on systems that have an ``io`` module.
