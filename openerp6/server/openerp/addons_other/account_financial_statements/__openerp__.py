==================================
ADDITIONAL SET-UP
==================================
Additional Financial Accounts setup to be done after module is implemented for correct reports.

ACCOUNT TYPE
	- Set up 'current' (default: True) flags for account only within the current period.
	- Set up 'operating' (default: True) flags for account concerning usual company operations.
	- Set up level 1 for correct IFRS account type split (Income/Expenses/Liabilities/assets/Equities).
	- Set up level2 attributes if more split details are required.
ACCOUNTS
	- Set up the correct user_type (account_account_type).
PLEASE NOTE:
	- For Income Statement : the level2 attribute is used to calculate cumulative totals based on sequence numbers
	- Signs on the reports are calculated based on the report_type field ("P&L / BS Category")
	- An example of hierarchy is given for level 1 and level 2. Those levels can be amended in the menu Account Report Attribute.  

==================================
MULTI-COMPANY REPORTING WIZARD PROCESS SUMMARY
==================================
- Choose the company and the periods for the report (Company must be a child of user's company)
- Allow to compare 2 periods.
- Allow to choose 5 custom levels for breakdown (level 1, level 2, user_type, operating and current)
- Allow to create reports with/without cumulative totals (needed anyway for Gross Profit report)

==================================
TO BE DONE 
==================================
- Create a report allowing to print a Income Statement of a closed period based on the closing journal of a period.
- Create multi-company Accounting Budget and incorporate to reporting. 

==================================
KNOWN BUGS 
==================================
First Data loading is incorrect and must corrected through OpoenERP client or PGAdmin:

- the parent company is assigned by default instead of the user's company
- the existing user_type level 1 and level 2 are left without default value

==================================
UNINSTALL 
==================================
Uninstall process can fail if some imported user_type are still assigned to accounts when the uninstall process is launch: 
so first change the user_type to a new value and launch uninstall process.
