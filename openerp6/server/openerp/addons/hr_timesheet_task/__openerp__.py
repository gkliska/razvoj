"""
This module allow you to enter your timesheet for a specific task and will automatically create a 'work done' entry
in the concerned task. Unless the project_timesheet module, this module base the work done of task on timesheet line 
(hr.analytic.timesheet), so we only have one object for all time recording entry.

Warning: you have to apply project_addons.patch (in the module's root) on the addons branch.
It modifies the sequence of the function fields of the project so they are computed after the function fields of the tasks.
This could not be overidded in this module and is necessary to have all the project indicators correctly computed.
