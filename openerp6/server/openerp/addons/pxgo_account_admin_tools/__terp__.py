Import tools:

- Import accounts from CSV files. This may be useful to import the initial
  accounts into OpenERP.

- Import account moves from CSV files. This may be useful to import the initial
  balance into OpenERP.


Check and Repair tools:

- Check the Chart of Accounts for problems in its structure. This will allow
  you to detect incoherences like the ones caused by bugs like
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/openobject-server/+bug/581137
  (the preordered tree [parent_left/parent_right] not matching the
  parent-child structure [parent_id]).

- Revalidate confirmed account moves so their analytic lines are regenerated.
  This may be used to fix the data after bugs like
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/openobject-addons/+bug/582988
  The wizard also lets you find account moves missing their analytic lines.

- Set the receivable/payable account of the partners, in moves and invoices
  where a generic receivable/payable account was used instead.

- Set the parent reference in account move lines where the receivable/payable
  account associated with the partner was used, but a partner reference wasn't
  set. This may fix cases where the receivable/payable amounts displayed in the
  partner form does not match the balance of the receivable/payable accounts.

- Set the reference in account moves, associated with invoices, that do not have
  the right reference (the reference from the invoice if it was a supplier
  invoice, or the number from the invoice if it was a customer invoice).
  This is useful to fix the account moves after changing the invoice references.
