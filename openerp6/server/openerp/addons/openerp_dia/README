ABOUT
=====

The openerp_dia module helps to develop new modules after an UML description using the DIA tool (http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia).

It’s not a typical module in the sense that you don’t have to install it on the server as another module. The contents of the module are just a python script for dia (codegen_openerp.py), a test dia diagram and the module generated by the test.

How to Use?
===========
For Ubuntu
----------
To use the module you need to make codegen_openerp.py accesible from dia, usually you need to put the codegen_openerp.py file under

/usr/share/dia/python/
or 
~/.dia/python/

directory and make sure that it gets loaded once. To do it, just open dia and open a Python Console from the Dialog Menu, and type there “import codegen_openerp”. If everything goes alright you will have a new option in your “Export...” dialog named “PyDia Code Generation (OpenERP)” that will create a zip module from your UML diagram.

For Windows
-----------
To install win Dia in windows, first install Python, then when you install Dia, you will have an option to install the python plug-in. After this, put the codegen_openerp.py file in C:\Program Files\Dia and you will have the export function in Dia.

Follow the syntax and conventions in Example given in file uml_test.dia in module directory.

Trouble shooting
================
If you find that the zip file is corrupt, use DiskInternals ZipRepair utility to repair the zip file before you’ll be able to import it - make sure the zip file you import has the same name you saved as.
