	"description" : """
Allows configuring products as a collection of other products. If such a product is added in a sale order, all the products of the pack will be added automatically (when storing the order) as children of the pack product.

The module has been made compatible with nan_external_prices and containts code to specifically handle when the module is available but they're still independent and there are no dependencies between them.
