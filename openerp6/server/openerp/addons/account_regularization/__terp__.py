	very similar to the account models named account.regularization. 
	Within this object you can define regularization moves, 
	This is, accounting moves that will automatically calculate the balance of a set of accounts, 
	Set it to 0 and transfer the difference to a new account. This is used, for example with tax declarations or in some countries to create the 'Profit and Loss' regularization
