If you select a collection of confirmed pickings in a list view, you can then use a collective action to force the reservation of all of them so they become available.
You can also process a collection of selected available pickings all together.
Not a daily best practise, but certainly useful to deal with historical data, such as orders imported from ecommerce for instance.
