Introduction
------------
Install OpenERP software (Server, Client and Web) on your Ubuntu system.
Currently installs OpenERP 6.0.2
These install files are not intended to be elegant, merely functional.
The impetus for writing these files was the sheer number of manual steps
required in
[this link.](http://doc.openerp.com/v6.0/install/index.html#installation-link)
The installation resulting from these files would be good for a demo or
proof-of-concept environment but would not be recommended for production.

These scripts are maintained at the [Github repo](https://github.com/JGifford/OpenERP-Install)

Requirements
------------
I tested with two fairly vanilla Ubuntu 10.04 LTS installations.

`2.6.32-28-generic-pae #55-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jan 10 22:34:08 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux`

`2.6.32-32-generic #62-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 20 21:54:21 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux`

Check yours with `uname -rvmo`
Your mileage may vary.


## install.sh


While some of the scripts are useful individually, all are accessible through
install.sh

`Usage: install.sh [server|client|web]`

### install.sh server

Installs PostgreSQL and the OpenERP Server on your host.


Creates a Postgres superuser `openerp` with password of `postgres` to get you
started. 

These settings (`db_user`, `db_password` and `db_host`) are added as options
to the OpenERP Server rc file, `.openerp_serverrc` and also
to `/etc/openerp-server.cfg`

Creates a system user `openerp` to run the openerp-server
Adds openERP Server to the boot sequence as a managed service.

Creates a log file in your home directory. You can watch it by typing:
	`tail -f ~/openERP_server_install.log`

### install.sh client

Installs the OpenERP Client on your host.
One of the first things needed will be to create a database:
File -> Databases -> New database

Creates a log file in your home directory. You can watch it by typing:
	tail -f ~/openERP_client_install.log

### install.sh web


Install the OpenERP Web client/server on your host.
(It acts like a client to the OpenERP Server and yet it serves web pages.)
Adds openERP Web to the boot sequence as a managed service.

Creates a log file in your home directory. You can watch it by typing:
	`tail -f ~/openERP_web_install.log`

## Starting & Stopping


### OpenERP Server

Usage:		sudo /etc/init.d/openerp-server start|stop|restart
Config file:	/etc/openerp-server.cfg
Log file:	/var/log/openerp/openerp-server.log

### OpenERP Client

Usage:		/usr/local/bin/openerp-client
Config file:	~/.openerprc
Log file:	unknown
Notes:		Make certain you're connected to a windowing environment
		(X11, etc.) before starting this process.
		One of the first things needed will be to create a database:
		File -> Databases -> New database

### OpenERP Web

Usage:		sudo /etc/init.d/openerp-web start|stop|restart
Config file:	none
Log file:	none (yet)

### openERP


The files in this directory are called by `install.sh` to do the actual
installation.

### `server.sh`


Corresponds to `./install.sh server`.

Also calls code to install /etc/init.d/openerp-server

### client.sh


Corresponds to `./install.sh client`

### web.sh


Corresponds to `./install.sh web`
Also calls code to install `/etc/init.d/openerp-web`


### init-files

The following files are called by install.sh to add openerp-server
and openerp-web to the boot sequence as managed services.

### openerp-server


Gets installed as: `/etc/init.d/openerp-server`
Depends on PostgreSQL
See Usage above

`openerp-server.cfg`


Gets installed as: `/etc/openerp-server.cfg`

### openerp-web

Gets installed as: `/etc/init.d/openerp-web`
Depends on `openerp-server`
See Usage above


To-Do
-----

Each install file spits all output (stderr and stout) to a named logfile.
OpenERP Server and OpenERP Web log files are properly stored, rotated & maintained
